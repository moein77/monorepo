# Monorepo: A Scalable Alternative to Micro Frontends

## What is a Monorepo?

A **monorepo** is a single repository containing multiple distinct projects with
well-defined relationships. In this approach, each menu or feature in your
application can be treated as an independent app, yet maintained within a
unified codebase.

While micro frontends advocate for separate repositories for each feature (e.g.,
each menu in your case), a monorepo allows all of these to coexist in a single
repository, simplifying collaboration and scaling.

monorepos simplify code sharing and cross-project refactorings, they
significantly lower the cost of creating libs, microservices and microfrontends.
So adopting a monorepo often enables more deployment flexibility.

## Why Use a Monorepo Over Micro Frontends?

In a **micro frontends** architecture, each menu or feature (such as those in
**pwa.780.ir**) is treated as a separate frontend project, often in its own
repository. While this provides some level of independence, it also introduces
several challenges, such as:

1. **Complex Code Sharing**: Sharing code across separate repositories is
   difficult and error-prone.
2. **Redundant Dependencies**: Each repo may duplicate shared dependencies,
   increasing maintenance overhead.
3. **Coordination Overhead**: Cross-repo changes to shared components or
   libraries are costly and often require synchronized releases.
4. **Inconsistent Tooling**: Each repo may have different build, test, or CI/CD
   setups, leading to inconsistencies.

### How a Monorepo Solves These Challenges

1. **Unified Codebase for Multiple Apps**: Instead of managing a separate
   repository for each menu or feature, a monorepo consolidates all apps (e.g.,
   each menu) into one repository. This reduces complexity and enhances
   collaboration.
2. **Efficient Code Sharing**: Shared components, libraries, or utilities are
   available to all apps in the monorepo without needing to publish or version
   them separately. This avoids redundancy and makes code reuse straightforward.
3. **Atomic Changes**: Cross-app changes, such as updates to a shared library,
   can be made atomically in a single commit, ensuring all apps remain in sync
   without the risk of breaking any functionality.
4. **Consistent Tooling**: All apps in the monorepo can share the same build,
   test, and CI/CD pipeline, making it easier to maintain and scale.

5. **Simplified Developer Experience**: Developers can easily move between apps
   (menus) in the same repository, making contributions across different
   features more efficient.

## Key Benefits of a Monorepo

1. **No Overhead to Create New Apps**: Reuse the same CI/CD pipeline and
   dependencies. Each new menu or feature can be treated as a new app within the
   same monorepo, reducing the setup time.
2. **One Version of Everything**: All apps use the same versions of
   dependencies, preventing version conflicts and simplifying maintenance.

3. **Developer Mobility**: With a shared development environment and tools,
   developers can easily contribute to different menus or features.

4. **Simplified Project Management**: All teams and developers work from the
   same source of truth, leading to more efficient coordination and
   collaboration.

5. **CI**: Moving to a monorepo requires you to rethink how you do continuous
   integration. After all, you are no longer building a single app. You are only
   building the things that are affected by your change.

## What Monorepo Tools Should Provide

Monorepo tools are critical for managing multiple apps efficiently. They should
offer:

1. **Dependency Graph Awareness**: Ensure that apps have access to the correct
   versions of shared dependencies.
2. **Incremental Builds**: Rebuild only the apps or parts of the project that
   have changed, optimizing performance.
3. **Code Ownership Tracking**: Define and manage ownership for specific apps or
   features by source managment tools (such as gitlab, github...)
4. **Scalability**: Handle a large number of apps, dependencies, and teams
   efficiently.
5. **Integrated CI/CD Support**: Seamless continuous integration and delivery
   across all apps.

## Why Not Micro Frontends?

In your case, with many distinct menus in **pwa.780.ir**, treating each menu as
a separate micro frontend in its own repo introduces unnecessary complexity:

- **Cross-repo changes become cumbersome**: If shared libraries need updates,
  managing and synchronizing changes across multiple repos is costly.
- **Duplicate code and dependencies**: Each repo would need its own copy of
  shared libraries, increasing maintenance overhead.
- **Diverging development environments**: Each menu might evolve with different
  build and test pipelines, leading to inconsistencies.

- **Cost of Maintenance**: Each app requires its own Git infrastructure.

  In a micro frontends architecture, each menu or feature is typically treated
  as an independent application, resulting in multiple repositories. This means
  that each app needs its own Git infrastructure, including branching
  strategies, version control, and CI/CD pipelines. Managing numerous
  repositories adds significant complexity, especially when dealing with:

  - **Duplicated Efforts in Utilities and Helpers**: In a micro frontends
    environment, utilities, helpers, and shared components often need to be
    managed as separate packages, published, versioned, and maintained across
    each repo. This introduces significant overhead as every change to a shared
    utility must be carefully coordinated to avoid breaking other apps.
    Developers need to publish new versions, update dependencies in each app,
    and ensure compatibility, which increases the effort and complexity of
    maintenance.

  - **Maintaining Micro Services for Shared Components**: When adopting micro
    frontends, each shared component (e.g., buttons, modals, forms) must also
    follow the micro approach, meaning you need to maintain these components as
    separate services or packages. Each menu (app) must then integrate these
    shared components, which requires careful versioning and dependency
    management. This adds an additional layer of complexity, as each micro
    frontend app must be updated whenever a shared component is modified or a
    new feature is added.

  Overall, this fragmentation of codebases increases the **cost of maintenance**
  significantly, as maintaining consistency and compatibility across apps
  becomes a constant challenge. In contrast, a **monorepo** consolidates
  everything into one place, where shared components, utilities, and helpers are
  centrally managed, simplifying updates and reducing maintenance costs.

By contrast, in a **monorepo**, each menu remains an independent app but
benefits from shared code, unified tooling, and streamlined collaboration,
offering a scalable and maintainable solution.

## Conclusion

A **monorepo** offers a more streamlined, scalable, and collaborative approach
for managing multiple apps (such as individual menus in **pwa.780.ir**) compared
to micro frontends. It addresses many of the inefficiencies and complexities
found in managing separate repositories, providing a unified development
environment thatâ€™s easier to maintain and scale.
